Arduino DC motor control w/ 4 flight modes

A throttle, pedal, and joystick will enable VTOL flight controls (3 low power DC motors).

The 4 flight modes are as follows:
  1. Idle: Controls input has no effect on motor speed
  2. Flight: Input to all controls manipulates motor speed
  3. Pan: Only joystick input manipulates motor
  4. One-to-one: Each control type (Throttle, Pedal, Joystick) manipulates its own motor
